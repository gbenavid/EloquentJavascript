  Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. 
  For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, 
  and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

/*
  ... Modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 
  (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
