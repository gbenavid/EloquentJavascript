// Quoting Style

// Imagine you have written a story and used single quotation marks
// throughout to mark pieces of dialogue. Now you want to replace all
// the dialogue quotes with double quotes, while keeping the single
// quotes used in contractions like aren’t.

// Think of a pattern that distinguishes these two kinds of quote
// usage and craft a call to the replace method that does the proper
// replacement.

var text = "'I'm the cook,' he said, 'it's my job.'";
// Change this call.
console.log(text.replace(/(^|\W)'|'(\W|$)/g, '$1"$2'));
// → "I'm the cook," he said, "it's my job."
