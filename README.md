# Eloquent Javascript
Here are my solutions to the problems written in Eloquent Javascript by Haverbeke. It's a really great book that I highly recommend if you are interested in a good read. Haverbeke explains tricky concepts in a simple, and occasionally humorous way. This is all _based on the second edition_.
