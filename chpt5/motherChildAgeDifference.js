Using the data from ./resources/ancestry.js, compute the average age difference between mothers and children. 
You can use the average function defined earlier in this chapter.

Note that not all the mothers mentioned in the data are themselves present in the array. The byName object, which makes it easy to find a person’s object from their name, might be useful here.

// filter out the mothers with no data
// find the mothers age
// find the average of all of those ages
// output average age of mothers
